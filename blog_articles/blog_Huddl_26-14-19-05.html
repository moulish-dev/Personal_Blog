            <div class="article-content">I am today in HuddleHive Hackathon. Conducted by Huddle Hive and sponsored by softwire and Hackathon Party. <br>  It is fun and it started with a scavenger hunt where each teams did tasks which involved the team and all the people .. like taking photos or doing riddles. In my team i had Dan Clubb, Angela Mykytiuk, Nancy Mogoko and Dimitrina Grazhdani. It was fun in the scavenger hunt. <br>
We were juggling between two ideas one-making people to learn managing money using gamification, two-giving the work life experience in the roles which the high schoolers like and at last based on their behavior choose their right career or what they like.<br> We brainstormed a lot. The first day is very good. Tomorrow is submission day.</div>

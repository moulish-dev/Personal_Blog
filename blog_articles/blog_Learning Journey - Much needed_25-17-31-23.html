            <div>I most often think what do i need but the ultimate thing i want to do is create better and free apps which is useful to the public or a large section of people and helps in making their life easier. \n But  I also do need to create something where i can integrate quantum computing and artificial intelligence. Also it is very much important in the health care sector. \n Today i finished the ML algorithms about  linear regression and k-nearest neighbors. \n I looked about how to create an app using electron.js for my django apps. Javascript looks good and i coming times i will include react js also but i feel these will remove the minimalistic design but i need to come back to these later. \n Next i looked about MongoDB in the databases section which looks good. \n Today classes were good and i need to see about the assignments and finish it earlier.</div>
